I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at JHU, being co-advised by <a href="https://nicolasloizou.github.io/">Nicolas Loizou</a> and <a href="http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html">Renè Vidal</a>. I am also affiliated with the Mathematical Institute of Data Science.
<br>
<br>

My research interests lie in the intersection of Optimization with Machine Learning, Game Theory and Theoretical computer science.
<br>
<br>

Before coming to the States, I graduated with a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I worked with <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/">Dimitris Fotakis</a> and <a href="https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/">Pavlos Efraimidis</a> on the intersection of opinion dynamics and theoretical computer science.

<h2>Research!</h2>
I am deeply passionate about understanding how AI models work at a foundational level. Through the lens of algorithms and optimization, I am interested in developing the theoretical foundations that characterize today's learning systems. I believe that by truly understanding and establishing a good scientific framework, we can ensure AI's safe, reliable, and impactful integration into our everyday lives.   

Beyond single-agent applications, I am, also, interested in interactions taking place in multi-agent environments. In such complex environments, multiple (AI)-agents are interacting with each other, each driven by their own incentives and goals. In that sense, I enjoy blending game theoretic concepts with optimization approaches for coordinating the interactions of the different agents and ensuring the successful function of the system as a whole.
