I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU),   
advised by Professor [Nicolas Loizou](https://nicolasloizou.github.io/) and Professor [Rene Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html).   
I am interested in algorithms for machine learning and optimization   
with the higher goal of providing theoretical guarantees for   
the reliable and successful use of machine learning algorithms.   
To achieve this, I enjoy combining my diverse research interests covering:   
theoretical computer science, optimization, machine learning and game theory.

Prior, I worked with Professor [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) and Professor [Pavlos Efraimidis](https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/) on the intersection of theoretical computer science and opinion dynamics. I received a joint BSc - MSc   
in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Greece.   

You can find my CV [here](_pages/Resume_Emmanouilidis_Konstantinos_revised.pdf).  
  
  
My first name is Constantinos or Konstantinos(from the Greek nameshake).
