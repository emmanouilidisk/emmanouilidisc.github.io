I am a PhD student in Computer Science at JHU,   
working with Professor <a href="https://nicolasloizou.github.io/"> Nicolas Loizou</a> and Professor <a href="http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html)"> Ren√® Vidal</a>.  
<br><br>
I am interested in algorithms for machine learning and optimization   
with the higher goal of providing theoretical guarantees for the   
reliable and successful use of machine learning algorithms.   
To achieve this, I enjoy combining my diverse research interests:   
machine learning, (multi-agent) optimization, theoretical computer science and game theory.
<br><br>
Prior, I worked with Professor <a href="https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/"> Dimitris Fotakis</a> and Professor <a href="https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/"> Pavlos Efraimidis</a>  
on the intersection of theoretical computer science and opinion dynamics.   
I received a joint BSc - MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Greece.
