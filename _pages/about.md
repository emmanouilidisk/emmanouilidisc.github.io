I am a graduate student in Computer Science at JHU,   
working with Professor [Nicolas Loizou](https://nicolasloizou.github.io/) and Professor [Rene Vidal](http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html).   
I am interested in algorithms for machine learning and optimization   
with the higher goal of providing theoretical guarantees for the   
reliable and successful use of machine learning algorithms.   
To achieve this, I enjoy combining my diverse research interests:   
theoretical computer science, (multi-agent) optimization, machine learning and game theory.

Prior, I worked with Professor [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) and Professor [Pavlos Efraimidis](https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/)   
on the intersection of theoretical computer science and opinion dynamics.   
I received a joint BSc - MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Greece.
